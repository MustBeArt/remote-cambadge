Remote Cambadge extension for the Hackaday Superconference 2017 Cambadge

This runs under MicroPython in an 8266-based board like an
Adafruit 8266 Huzzah, connected to the serial port on the
expansion header of the Cambadge from the 2017 Hackaday
Superconference.

The bare Cambadge has a camera and a screen, and lets the user
record still photos in BMP format and videos in AVI format.
The purpose of the Remote Cambadge is to make these images
available remotely via WiFi.
